<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Hi! I am Pranav Harwadekar, a Computer Science Honors student at Texas A&M University. I am a passionate developer, researcher, and learner with experience spanning industry, research, and product development. I interned at McKesson (Supplylogix) as a Software Engineering Intern, where I built large-scale forecasting pipelines with PySpark and MLflow to optimize pharmacy inventory across 10,000+ sites. I previously completed data analytics externships with Beats by Dre—where I was selected as one of just 5 representatives nationwide to present directly to the Head of Consumer Insights—and Webacy Inc., a Web3 security startup focusing on smart contract risk assessment.</p>
<p>On campus, I lead the Autonomous Navigation team for Texas A&M's international rover project, building ROS2-based navigation and Stereo SLAM systems. My research experience includes undergraduate ML projects through the Aggie Research Program and hyperspectral imaging algorithm development in CUDA and C++. I've also developed and launched apps on the App Store.</p>
<p>Beyond technical work, I serve as a Cengage Student Ambassador, Engineering Honors Executive Committee Service Chair, and former UNICEF USA National Youth Ambassador, combining leadership and service with innovation. I am currently a Software Engineering Fellow at Headstarter AI, building AI-powered products with React, Next.js, and Vercel.</p>

<h2>Culture + Values</h2>
<p>I value kindness, respect, loyalty, and integrity. I believe in treating others with respect and empathy, and I strive to make a positive impact in my community.

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>I enjoy playing sports and am an adventurous person who loves to explore new places and try new things. I enjoy meeting new people and learning about different cultures. My friends would describe me as friendly, curious, and up to try something new. I'm hoping to study abroad in the future to immerse myself in a different culture.</p>
